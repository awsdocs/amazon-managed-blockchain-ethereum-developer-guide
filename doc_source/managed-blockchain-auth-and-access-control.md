IAM permissions policies are associated with AWS users in your account and determine who has access to what\. Permissions policies specify the actions that each user can perform using Managed Blockchain and other AWS services\.

Before you configure IAM permissions, see [Identity and Access Management for Ethereum on Amazon Managed Blockchain](security-iam.md)\. We also recommend [What is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) and [IAM JSON Policy Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
