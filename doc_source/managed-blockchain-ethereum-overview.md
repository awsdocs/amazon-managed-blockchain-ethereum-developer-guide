# What is Amazon Managed Blockchain<a name="managed-blockchain-ethereum-overview"></a>

Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and managing blockchain networks and network resources using open\-source frameworks\. Blockchain allows you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and transparently run transactions and share data without the need for a trusted, central authority\.

You can use Managed Blockchain to create scalable blockchain resources and networks quickly and efficiently using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Managed Blockchain SDK\. 

Managed Blockchain scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions\. Managed Blockchain also simplifies the management of blockchain networks and resources after they are up and running\. Managed Blockchain manages your certificates, lets you easily create proposals for a vote among network members where applicable, and helps you track operational metrics related to requests, computational load, memory usage, and data storage\.

This guide covers the fundamentals of creating and working with Ethereum blockchain resources using Managed Blockchain\.
